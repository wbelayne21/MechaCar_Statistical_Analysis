## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Linear Regression D1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92958091/152842656-f860e90d-dd68-448d-a3a3-34aab382ee3d.png)
- Vehicle length, ground clearance as well as intercept have zero probavility of contributing to a random variance. This means that these factors have the greatest impact on the mpg of a car.
- The solpe of the linear model is not zero. This is because our P-value is 5.35e-11 which is significantly less than the significance level of 0.05 which in turn warrants that there is significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis. 
- Our multiple R-squared value of 0.712 indicates a strong corelation among the independent metrices we analyzed against mpg. Therefore we can say that the corelation is sufficient to predict mpg of MechaCar Prototypes.
